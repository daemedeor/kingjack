Kingjack - "A game of 21"

Personal Workflow-

End Result is a function that shuffles a deck of 52 cards and "deals" the cards to two players in a completely random fashion.

I need to research the most efficient shuffling techniques and I need to build the function in a way that is compatible with Kingtak's deck model. 

I will utilize the Fisher-Yates Shuffle to shuffle through an array and randomize the cards by utilizing a while loop to randomly select elements that haven't been sorted and switching them in a decreasing fashion (so that only unrandomized cards become randomized).

Finish the shuffling portion in a two hour time frame after which I will work on splicing cards to another array thus "dealing cards".

After I finish I will combine my results with the deck and GUI created by Kingtak and Ray respectively.
